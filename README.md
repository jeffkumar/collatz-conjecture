# Collatz Conjecture

Collatz conjecture states the following. If you take any whole number and that number is odd multiply it by 3 and add one. If it is even then divide that number by 2. If you do this enough times, you will end with the numbers 4, 2, and 1 every time. No mathmetician has proven this, but if you experiement, you will see that it is true. This is the beauty of the Collatz conjecture.
